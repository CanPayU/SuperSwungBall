    "msgdicdac1": "Welcome to the tutorial",
    "msgdicdac2": "There I will teach you \n how to play SuperSwungBall",
    "msgdicdac3": "The aim is to score a touchdown \n behind the opponent's goal row",
    "msgdicdac4": "To perform it, \n each player controls his team of Swungmen",
    "msgdicdac5": "Let's start with the Swungmen's controls",
    "msgdicdac6": "This is a Swungman, \n you can click on it in order to control it",
    "msgdicdac7": "Every Swungmen have four abilities \n we will discover step by step",
    "msgdicdac8": "First, the ability of displacement \n is represented by the color blue",
    "msgdicdac9": "Press the blue button 3 times to make him \n run as fast and as far as possible",
    "msgdicdac10": "You can click on the displacement zone (blue) \n to control its displacement",
    "msgdicdac11": "Well, now we'll see \n how recover the ball",
    "msgdicdac12": "For this, \n you must at least have a ball-control point",
    "msgdicdac13": "Put 1 point in the mastery of the ball (in pink) \n and 2 points in the displacement",
    "msgdicdac14": "Now move to the ball \n ('Space' to start the displacement)",
    "msgdicdac15": "We now have the ball, \n throw it somewhere",
    "msgdicdac16": "To throw the ball, \n you must at least have a ball-control point",
    "msgdicdac17": "Put 3 points of mastery in the pass (still pink) \n to make a pass as far as possible",
    "msgdicdac18": "Click in the pink zone and then move the pink dot \n to mark the location of the pass",
    "msgdicdac19": "You can start the action from now \n and press 'a' to make the pass",
    "msgdicdac20": "What a pass! But take care, \n an enemy is coming",
    "msgdicdac21": "He took the ball and wants to go this way. \n We must stop him.",
    "msgdicdac22": "To engage in combat there is only one way: \n one of the two Swungmen must at least have tackle",
    "msgdicdac23": "He certainly don't want to fight since he has the ball, \n so we have to engage in combat!",
    "msgdicdac24": "Put two points in the tackle (green) \\n and a point in the pass (to recover the ball if you tackle) \\ n and rushe towards him",
    "msgdicdac25": "There is a good tackle ! \n You went there so hard \n he ended down and has not finished its displacement",
    "msgdicdac26": "Normally when an enemy has ended down \n it is weakening for the next round",
    "msgdicdac27": "So I heal for the good of our training \n Easy life is for later",
    "msgdicdac28": "It will surely try to tackle you \n to make you lose the ball",
    "msgdicdac29": "So put maximum points in your dodge capability \n (in yellow) and rushe towards him",
    "msgdicdac30": "As expected he engaged in combat and we won \n because we had more \" fighting force \" than him",
    "msgdicdac31": "The fighting force is the maximum value \n put in a tackle OR dodging",
    "msgdicdac32": "You must then be careful \n how to match these points",
    "msgdicdac33": "Each character has different \n base stats in each mastery",
    "msgdicdac34": "To be familiar with these stats is therefore crucial \n to not be surprised by the result of a fight",
    "msgdicdac35": "Still, be careful not to do too much fighting \n because more fights you win, \n more you will be weakened for the next one",
    "msgdicdac36": "To do a pass teammate, \n even if it is behind you, \n can be a good way to pass through the enemy defense ",
    "msgdicdac37": "You now have all the keys \n to compare yourself to other players!",
    "msgdicdac38": "To prove that you really have the levvel to, \n you must pass a final test",
    "msgdicdac39": "You just have to score a goal",
    "msgdicdac40": "Five new Swungmen appeared, \n one is in your team, \n feel free to use it",
    "msgdicdac41": "You're free score the goal as you like \n it's time to put into practice what you have learned",
    "msgdicdac42": "Great goal !",
    "msgdicdac43": "You've got a lot to learn to become the best \n anyways I see a great potential in you, \n you will succeed",
    "msgdicdac44": "There your time to show what you are worth confronting the players \n serious things are finally starting!",
